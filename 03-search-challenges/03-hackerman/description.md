I've designed this challenge as a game. You can play this game if you run the python script 'verify.py'. If you don't understand what to do in  the game, I've written a more literal guide below. It's hidden to not spoil it, but you can scroll down if you want.

This challenge want you to write two regex's

If you don't know what a regex is, please go to https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/Regexe.html

You need to write one regex which matches an english word followed by a number, for example elephant77
You need to write another regex which matches exactly 7 vowels in a row, followed by a dot, followed by either "foo", "bar", or "baz" (no quotes)

Put the regex's you made in solution.txt

To see if your regex is correct, please run verify.py and check if you see green text
