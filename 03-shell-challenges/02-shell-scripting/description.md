# Shell scripting

## 1. Introduction

Shell scripting is a powerful tool that allows you to automate repetitive tasks in the shell.
Start with reading the chapters "Home", "Philosophy" and "A First Script" in the following tutorial: [Shell Scripting Tutorial](https://www.shellscript.sh/).

## 2. Challenge

Create a solution.txt file in this folder. Write the answer to the questions below on a separate line. Use the tutorial above to help you with the answers. You should use the solutions as described in the tutorial.

You can try out the commands in your local git bash terminal or an online bash terminal emulator like [this one](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/execute_bash_online.php).

1. What is the extension of a shell script file? (dot included)
2. What line is used to specify which shell to use in a shell script?
3. Which file permission is required to run a shell script?
4. What is the full command to make a shell script named "myscript" executable and readable?
5. How do you run "myscript" from the current directory?
6. Which character is used in shell scripts to put comments (lines of code that are not executed)?
7. How do you print out the question "What is your age?"?
8. How do you capture the users' answer to the question "What is your age?" in a variable named "AGE"?
9. The last three lines of the solution.txt should contain the code to test if the value of the variable "AGE" is less than 18. If it is, print "You are underage". Don't put any leading or trailing spaces and unecessary semicolons in solution.txt.

## 3. General rules

In order to get a "SUCCESS" from the verify script, you will need to make sure that:

- You have followed the instructions exactly as described in the text. Do not put extra text in files or create extra folders unless asked to do so.
- Assume that the verify script is case-sensitive. Pay attention to the exact naming of files and folders.
- Never make changes to the verify script (yes, we will verify all verify scripts afterwards). Changes to the verify script will result in a "FAIL" for the entire challenge.
- You will only receive a "SUCCESS" if you complete all the steps successfully. If you only complete part of the challenge steps, you will receive a "FAIL" for the entire challenge.
